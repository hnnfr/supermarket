Problem 1:
CategoryTest.testAddItem()
When add an Item into a Category, in the method Category.addItem(Item), there should be a call to item.setCategory(this).
Without this call explicit, the adding of Item and saving of Item and Category seem not working well (as if there is
no way to flush the change into the database).

Problem 2:
LazyFetch
When using lazy fetching (fetch = FetchType.LAZY) with Item.pricingHistories, we should have methods that do not
load the collection property (pricingHistories) - default method of JPA or methods without specifying loading request
for fetching the properties (like Item getItemByCode(String code); of ItemRepository). And we should also have
methods that explicitly load the collection property with @Query (like Item getItemWithPricingHistories(String code);
of ItemRepository)
